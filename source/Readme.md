# steven-implementation

This is a base-level implementation of this challenge.

The code (especially the JavaScript) is first-pass grade.  It's neither elegant
nor something you should seek to emulate.

## Getting started

`bundle && shotgun`

Visit `/`/ for the non-JavaScript app
Visit `/js` for the JavaScript driven app
Run `bundle exec rspec` to run the specs

## Testing

Testing is minimal, just for demo purposes

I do some testing of a controller route, for reference purposes and do a
trivial test of the GameBrain class

## Partials

I do make some decent use of partials.

## Bugs

I'm pretty sure that I've not worked everything out cleanly.  I wrote this in a
hurried state, so you may find bugs, but the main point of this is to show how
to attack the problem, one bite at a time :)
