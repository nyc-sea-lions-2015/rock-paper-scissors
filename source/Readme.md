# steven-implementation

This is a base-level implementation of this challenge.

The code (especially the JavaScript) is first-pass grade.  It's neither elegant
nor something you should seek to emulate.

## Testing

Testing is minimal, just for demo purposes

## Partials

I do make some decent use of partials.
