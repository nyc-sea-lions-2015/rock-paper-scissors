# Challenge Name


## Summary
Introduce the challenge to the students. After reading the Summary section, students should have a solid understanding of how this specific challenge relates to the overall curriculum:

- what students will be learning in this challenge
- how this challenge relates to previous challenges
- how this challenge relates to future challenges

### New Technology/Concept
Provide a frame of reference for any new technologies or concepts that they will encounter in the challenge. If the challenge requires students to use a new technology, (e.g., a gem), state how the gem will be used in the challenge, link to the docs, and consider providing some example code to kickstart the student.  If the challenge introduces a new concept (e.g. lazy evaluation), provide the student with some background information on the concept and how it will be used in this challenge.

### Other New Technology/Concept
If more than one new technology or concept is introduced in the challenge, add a subsection for each.


## Releases
### Pre-release: Description
The Pre-release subsection is optional.  Use a Pre-release subsection if students need to perform some setup before beginning the challenge (e.g., seed a database).  The Pre-release subsection should provide directions on how to setup the challenge and a description about what the setup is providing.  Depending on how familiar students are expected to be with performing the set up procedures, the directions might be more or less explicit.  If the setup procedures are new to the students, walk them through the commands they need to run (e.g., "From the command line, run `rake db:seed`").  If students should be familiar with the setup procedures, it might be appropriate to tell them what needs to be done (e.g., "Seed the database").

### Release 0: Description
The Release 0 subsection is the only required subsection of the Releases section. Detail the requirements of the challenge; it should be clear to students what success for this challenge looks like.

### Release 1: Description
If completing the challenge should be done in steps, then detail each step in its own numbered subsection as appropriate.  Each subsection should have a clearly defined outcome.

## Conclusion
Provide the students with some closure for the challenge.  Reinforce why students completed this challenge and provide a check on whether they have achieved the desired learning from the challenge.
